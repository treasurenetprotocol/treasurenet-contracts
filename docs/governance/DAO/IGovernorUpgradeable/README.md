# IGovernorUpgradeable

## Functions

Gets the version of the governor instance.

Describes the possible `support` values for `castVote` and the way these votes are counted.

- `string`: URL-encoded sequence of key-value pairs describing vote options and interpretation

### hashProposal(address\[\] memory targets,bytes\[\] memory calldatas,bytes32 descriptionHash) -> uint256

Hashing function used to (re)build the proposal id from the proposal details.

- `targets`: Array of target contract addresses
- `calldatas`: Array of contract call data
- `descriptionHash`: Hash of the proposal description

- `uint256`: ID of the proposal

### state(uint256 proposalId) -> ProposalState

Gets the current state of a proposal.

- `proposalId`: ID of the proposal

- `ProposalState`: Current state of the proposal

### proposalSnapshot(uint256 proposalId) -> uint256

Gets the block number used to retrieve user's votes and quorum.

- `proposalId`: ID of the proposal

- `uint256`: Block number

### proposalDeadline(uint256 proposalId) -> uint256

Block number at which votes close.

> \[!TIP\]   
> Votes close at the end of this block, so it is possible to cast a vote during this block.

- `proposalId`: ID of the proposal

- `uint256`: Block number

### updateDelay(uint256 newDelay)

Updates the proposal voting delay.

- `newDelay`: New voting delay value

### votingDelay() -> uint256

Gets the current proposal voting delay.

- `uint256`: Current voting delay value

### votingPeriod() -> uint256

Delay, in number of blocks, between the vote start and vote ends.

> \[!WARNING\]   
> The {votingDelay} can delay the start of the vote. 
> This must be considered when setting the voting duration compared to the voting delay.

- `uint256`: Current voting period value

### quorum(uint256 blockNumber) -> uint256

Minimum number of cast voted required for a proposal to be successful.

> \[!WARNING\]   
> The `blockNumber` parameter corresponds to the snapshot used for counting vote.
> This allows to scale the quorum depending on values such as the totalSupply of a token at this block (see {ERC20Votes}).

- `blockNumber`: Block number for the snapshot

- `uint256`: Quorum value

### hasVoted(uint256 proposalId,address account) -> bool

Checks if a voter has voted on a proposal.

- `proposalId`: ID of the proposal

> \[!TIP\]   
> Some module can modify the requirements for execution, for example by adding an additional timelock.

- `targets`: Array of target contract addresses
- `calldatas`: Array of contract call data
- `descriptionHash`: Hash of the proposal description

### castVote(uint256 proposalId,uint8 support) -> uint256

Casts a vote for a proposal.

- `proposalId`: ID of the proposal
- `support`: Support type (Against, For, Abstain)
